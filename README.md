### **Express Application for FastFeet project**

A fast way to manage delivery companies!

## **📚 About the project**

With this API is possible to manage users, recipients, delivery man and everything what is needed for the delivery flow.

To confirm the delivery was finished, the delivery man must send a recipient signature photo. This is one of the application business rules.
